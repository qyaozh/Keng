\title{Cut-off values of r given the sample size n.}
\usage{
cut_r(n)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Sample size of the \emph{r}.}
}
\value{
A data.frame including the cut-off values of \emph{r} at the significance levels of \emph{p} = 0.1, 0.05, 0.01, 0.001.  \emph{r} with the absolute value larger than the cut-off value is significant at the corresponding significance level.
}
\description{
Cut-off values of r given the sample size n.
}
\details{
Given \emph{n} and \emph{p}, \emph{t} and then \emph{r} could be determined. The formula used could be found in \code{test_r()}'s documentation.
}
\examples{
cut_r(193)
