\title{Test r using the t-test and fisher's z given r and n.}
\usage{
test_r(r, n)
}
\arguments{
\item{r}{Pearson correlation.}

\item{n}{Sample size of \emph{r}.}
}
\value{
A list including \emph{r}, \emph{t} -test of \emph{r} (\code{SE_r}, \code{t}, \code{p_r}),
\emph{CI} of \emph{r} based on \emph{t} -test (\code{LLCI_r_t}, \code{ULCI_r_t}),
\emph{fz} (Fisher's z)  of \emph{r}, \emph{z} -test of Fisher's z (\code{SE_fz}, \code{z}, \code{p_fz}), and \emph{CI} of \emph{r} derived from \emph{fz}.
Note that the returned \emph{CI} of \emph{r} may be out of \emph{r}'s valid range [-1, 1].
This "error" is deliberately left to users, who should correct the CI manually when reporting.

\description{
Test r using the t-test and fisher's z given r and n.
}
\details{
To test the significance of the \emph{r} using one-sample \emph{t}-test,
the \emph{SE} of the \emph{r} is determined by the following formula: \code{SE = sqrt((1 - r^2)/(n - 2))}.
Another way is transforming \emph{r} to Fisher's Z using the following formula:
\code{fz = atanh(r)} with the \emph{SE} of \code{fz} being \code{sqrt(n - 3)}.
Note that Fisher's z is commonly used to compare two Pearson's correlations from independent samples.
Fisher's transformation is presented here for satisfying the curiosity of users interested in the difference of \emph{t} -test and fisher's transformation.
