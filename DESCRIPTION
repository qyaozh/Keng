Description: Miscellaneous functions and data used in psychological research and teaching. 
    Keng currently has a built-in dataset depress, and could (1) scale a vector;
    (2) compute the cut-off values of Pearson's r with known sample size; 
    (3) test the significance and compute the post-hoc power for Pearson's r with known sample size; 
    (4) conduct prior power analysis and plan the sample size for Pearson's r;
    (5) compare lm()'s fitted outputs using R-squared, f_squared, post-hoc power, 
    and PRE (Proportional Reduction in Error, also called partial R-squared or partial Eta-squared); 
    (6) calculate PRE from partial correlation, Cohen's f, or f_squared; 
    (7) conduct prior power analysis and plan the sample size for one or a set of predictors in regression analysis;
    (8) conduct post-hoc power analysis for one or a set of predictors in regression analysis with known sample size.
