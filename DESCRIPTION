Description: Miscellaneous functions and data used in psychological research and teaching. Keng 
    currently has a built-in dataset depress, and could (1) scale a vector; (2) compute the cut-off 
    values of Pearson's r with known sample size; (3) test the significance and compute the post-hoc
    power for Pearson's r with known sample size; (4) conduct a priori power analysis and plan the 
    sample size for Pearson's r; (5) compare lm()'s fitted outputs using R-squared, f_squared, 
    post-hoc power, and PRE (Proportional Reduction in Error, also called partial R-squared or 
    partial Eta-squared); (6) calculate PRE from partial correlation, Cohen's f, or f_squared; 
    (7) conduct a priori power analysis and plan the sample size for one or a set of predictors in 
    regression analysis; (8) conduct post-hoc power analysis for one or a set of predictors in 
    regression analysis with known sample size; (9) randomly pick numbers for Chinese Super Lotto
    and Double Color Balls; (10) assess course objective achievement in Outcome-Based Education.
