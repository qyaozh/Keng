\title{Cut-off values of Pearson's correlation r with known sample size n.}
\usage{
cut_r(n)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Sample size of Pearson's correlation r. \code{n} should be larger than}
}
\value{
A data.frame including the cut-off values of r at the significance levels of p = 0.1, 0.05, 0.01, 0.001.  r with the absolute value larger than the cut-off value is significant at the corresponding significance level.
}
\description{
Cut-off values of Pearson's correlation r with known sample size n.
}
\details{
Given n and p, t and then r could be determined. The formula used could be found in \code{test_r()}'s documentation.

\examples{
cut_r(193)
