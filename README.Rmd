<!-- badges: end -->


The `Keng` package is named after Loo-Keng Hua, who made great achievements in mathematics mainly through self-study. Loo-Keng Hua encouraged novices to show their axe skills at the gate of Ban's house, so the `Keng` package comes. In addition, `Keng` is the abbreviation of "Knock Errors off Nice Guesses."

The `Keng` package aims to automate the computations Qingyao repeat in his psychological research and teaching. Hope the functions and data gathered in this package help to ease your life.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `Keng` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("qyaozh/Keng", dependencies = TRUE, build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Load

Before using the `Keng` package, load it using the `library()` function.

```{r library}
library(Keng)
```

## List of contents

Here is a list of the functions and data gathered in the `Keng` package. Their usages are detailed in the documentation.

### Data

`depress` is a subset of data from a research about depression and coping.

### Variable transformation

`Scale()` could change the origin of a numeric vector `x` (including mean-centering it), or standardize the mean and standard deviation of `x` (including transforming it to its z-score).

### Pearson's *r*

`cut_r()` gives you the cut-off values of Pearson's *r* at the significance levels of *p* = 0.1, 0.05, 0.01, 0.001 when the sample size *n* is known.

`test_r()` tests the significance of *r* using *t*-test and Fisher's z when *r* and *n* is known.

### The linear model

`compare_lm()` compares `lm()`'s fitted outputs using *PRE*, *R*^2^, *f*^2^, and post-hoc power.

`calc_PRE()` calculates PRE from partial correlation, Cohen's f, or f_squared.

`power_lm()` computes the post-hoc power and/or plans the sample size for one or a set of predictors in regression analysis.
